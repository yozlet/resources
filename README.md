# Resources

Are you a designer interested in doing open source design or simply seeing what open source can offer you to work on your non-open source projects? Look no further. Here is a collection of great tools, libraries, reading material, and media for you to use, for free (as in cost), while you spread the free (as in freedom) love of open source design!

- [Projects](projects.md) - list of open source projects with an 
attenion to design
- [People](people.md) - list of designers who work heavily on open 
source projects and tools  

---

Designers are not only designers who finish a concept and »hand it off« to 
developers who implement it – that won’t happen. The key is continuous dialog 
with the people who could implement it, small steps, incremental improvements 
and documenting your designs clearly so it’s understandable why the changes you 
propose are better than the current state.


## Tools

* Use a pen & paper for [mockups and 
prototypes](http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping). No hi-fi Photoshop 
work needed.
* Design discussion on the issue tracker of the project. For example at 
[GitHub](http://github.com) – get an account, identify design issues, 
participate, and open new issues. Establish a »Design« tag on the tracker to 
group these issues, for example like in the [Nextcloud 
issues](https://github.com/nextcloud/core/issues?labels=Design).
* If you want to dive into the code (awesome!) just check on the project page 
how to set up a development environment and get going.
